                <p align="center" class="colored_bold">Feeling At Home</p>
                <p align="center">by Alex Brown  </p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">They can evoke a beaming smile, or floods of tears; happy reflection or the bittersweet pangs of nostalgia for that which is irrevocably gone.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:0;">Crystal Deshaies&rsquo; art hits &ndash; literally &ndash; close to home. Her commissioned acrylic paintings of homes and gardens speak not just of bricks and mortar and vegetation, but of the love we bring to them.</p>
                <p>In their inclusion of well-loved homes, favourite shrubs, cherished pets and symbols of loved ones, Deshaies paintings reveal the innermost workings of what we call the human heart &ndash; everything her subjects and clients hold dear.</p>
                <p>Thanks to the generosity of some of these clients, a selection of these paintings will be on display at Surrey Public Library&rsquo;s Ocean Park branch from June 30 to late August. Weather permitting, Deshaies will also be on hand at the branch during the Ocean Park Days celebration, June 23, for a preview of her work.</p>
<p>Given the accuracy of her drawing, and sureness of perspective, it&rsquo;s not surprising that Deshaies &ndash; who studied music, art and architecture at UBC &ndash; found an early career as an architectural illustrator and design consultant.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;In the mid &rsquo;80s I was working for an architect who suggested I do a portrait of his family&rsquo;s home, including their cat and some tulips,&rdquo; she recalled.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:0;">&ldquo;The home and garden portraits all seemed to grow out of that.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Almost alone in the field of home portraiture, Deshaies follows a meticulous process in creating her paintings, which can take between three to six weeks to finish. It&rsquo;s not just a matter of setting an easel down in front of a house &ndash; Deshaies interviews her clients extensively to get a sense of who they are and what they care about .</p>
                <p>She takes photographs, studies objects, borrows family portraits, all of which will provide compositional elements for a preliminary drawing, followed by the finished painting.</p>
                <p>The raw material may be a collage; but the finished article is not<span class="italic">. </span>Deshaies prides herself on her command of composition and perspective to create a seamless portrait &ndash; even if part of the backyard finds its way into the front yard, or some of the living room finds its way into the garden.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;I call it cubist realism, although the perspective looks realistic, it can show several views at the same time.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>The paintings in the upcoming exhibition all represent residences on the Peninsula &ndash; a frequent source of commissions over the past decade. They provide a revealing portrait of the community in very human terms.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;I feel I know the area,&rdquo; the Vancouver-based Deshaies said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out here so frequently, it kind of feels like a second home.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:0;">&ldquo;The people here do tend to be, very often, artistic. I&rsquo;m really struck by that &ndash; they have a real appreciation for art and understand what the artist brings in terms of labour intensity, composition, design, colour and why something is beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
                <p>Her Peninsula paintings typify Deshaies&rsquo; techniques and her love of cheerful colours (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m like Matisse,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I believe there&rsquo;s enough darkness and sadness in life.&rdquo;)</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">A painting of a South Surrey hobby farm &ndash; since redeveloped &ndash; memorializes a favourite red maple tree, a Shetland pony, budgies and some prized chickens.</p>
                <p style="margin-top:0;">Another, of a very modern looking, yet gabled home in the Morgan Creek area, conveys the enthusiasms of the owners by transplanting some of the living room &ndash; including a guitar, books and furniture, into the front yard &ndash; along with a pet sheep, cats, hawks, falcon, deer and other wildlife.</p>
                <p>Invariably, Deshaies said, the unveiling of the finished painting is an emotional experience &ndash; even if the tears are ultimately happy ones. And the artist finds herself touched by the glimpses into others&rsquo; lives she is allowed.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;It is very moving,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;The house is really a symbol of you. Even if the house is not a big one, or designed in the latest Architectural Digest style, if you put your love into the house it is still beautiful &ndash; it has a beautiful integrity.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;Sometimes people put their children into the painting, but often in a symbolic, poetic way &ndash; through a hockey stick or a basketball, for instance.&rdquo;</p>
                <p style="margin-top:0;">Pets are often more directly depicted, she said.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;We love our pets. They signify home and keep us grounded &ndash; and I love painting animals&rdquo; (one of her sidelines, her Winsome Portraits series, focuses on individual animals as well as people).</p>
                <p>More than a simple commission, Deshaies considers each painting a compact with a client &ndash; and a collaboration.</p>
                <p>&ldquo;This is where people have lived and where they have raised their children. When they request a home portrait by me, they want more than a sketch. They want to include cherished objects that have a significance to them.</p>
                <p style="margin-bottom: 0;">&ldquo;But, more than a memento, it&rsquo;s a work of art &ndash; and it has to be a work of art first.&rdquo;</p>
