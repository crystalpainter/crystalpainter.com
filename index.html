    <div class="quotes">
      My passion is painting, and my gift and joy is to be able to give people back
      themselves in the form of a painting. The study of music gave me a great
      appreciation for the relationship of form and content, and I have transposed
      the musical terms of composition, rhythm, harmony, and colour in my visual work
      to express the passion I have for life, people, and my community.<br /> — Crystal Deshaies

            We can also see around corners--all composed in one view. The Adarondac chair seen
            through the gate is the same chair as on the left, behind the Great Blue Heron,
            which does live in the cedar tree, second from the left, his mate flying home in the
            distance. They walked the Alsasian Dog on the beach every day for years; the
            old bike and doghouse are memories they like to keep;

            culture and Art. As you can see, the children love to play in their
            landscaping, and love to study the violin and piano. They love their home and wanted
            to show it off and meaningful belongings. There was a golf cart too, but it was
            moved behind the tree... The artist created the perspective to show both the front and
            back of the house, showing two views "in one".
